### Stage 1
* Simulate sea level ISP
* Simulate earth rotation
* Compute dV losses
* Indicate if PEG fails to compute parameters
* Cutoff when orbital speed is exactly reached (might account for vertical velocity)
### Stage 2
* Simulate crashes
* Simulate atmospheric drag
* Simulate aerodynamic failure
* Simulate atmospheric heating
* Simulate times between staging
### Stage 3
* Implement multi-stage PEG
* Implement impossible to shutdown solid motors?
* Provide lots of rocket models
* Ascents on other bodies (LEM ascent)
* Automatic finding of good parameters for optimal ascent
### Stage 4
* 3D version with azimuth calculations? 
* Historic launchpad coordinates?
* Orbits beyond one body?
* Suicide burns
* Descent guidance

### Stage 92
* Graphics
* Actually launches a rocket IRL
